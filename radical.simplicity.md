If we are going to make up new symbols for mathematical objects for every new presentation, why not use `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, ... instead of &xi;<sub>x<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub></sub>, &xi;<sub>x<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub></sub>, &xi;<sub>x<sub>i<sub>3</sub></sub></sub>, &hellip;?



In fact we can be even simpler by using blocks of colour.  Instead of calling the elements of a free group something that requires learning an alphabet, just use blobs / circles / squares coloured `red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`, `purple` --- these are just as good elements of a free basis as `x_1, x_2, x_3, ...`.




If I get hit by a truck in the next year, somebody look through my papers and pick up the task of making a watercolour children's-book exposition of schemes and cohomology.


If, in fact, they are as simple as Grothendieck claimed, then you should be able to show them to a pre-linguistic person [cave of dreams, mcluhanisms, lurya, harpers] and they could get insight into it.
