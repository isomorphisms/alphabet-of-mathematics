## comments on style and esthetic

In the early 20th century, mathematics was infested

- G&ouml;del
- Polish spaces
- _Logicomix_
- set theory
- recursion



In logic books (Whitehead/Russell, _____, ____, ____) you will see uninterpretable strings of formal symbols like &Phi;[&fnof;_i,T<x&rarr;y,F>]  etc etc.


The idea that, like a computer [link to aeon.co story of brain-is-computer mythos] humans can parse arbitrary symbols so &phi;, x, a, &xi; are all equivalent to us.




Contemporary mathematicians seem to realise that this is not the case, so F: E &rarr; B or [stacks project] "let an elliptic curve be `(E,0,B)`" is known to spark associations with things seen before, and these are _actively leveraged_.


In other words, `the stacks project` _wouldn't_ define a scheme to be `(a,b,c) where a is ___, b is ___, c is ___` because they know that, for their audience, `(F,E,B)` will be suggestive and useful.


In other words, the full meaning of a mathematical text lies [in the community][thurston arxiv paper] and in the culture of individuals --- against the bourbakian ideal, it is not comprehensively defined in one source.




###### The purpose of this glossary is to collate  the references required to make those associations.

Because of the way school, college, graduate school, and popular-science-writing relate today,

These topics are now d&eacute;mod&eacute; among working mathematicians, but popular lore (_Logicomix_, undergraduate math and computer-science courses; programmers 


### What _Algebra_ means when it's the only word in the title

Some of the esthetic from  that period has survived, eg the groups - rings - fields approach which, according to Wikipedia, was pioneered by Noether and first formalised in van der Waerden's _Algebra_. A series of books titled _Algebra_ by eg Mac Lane/Birkhoff, Hungerford, Artin (with the goal of comprehensivity such a broad title implies) have advanced different philosophies but still cover the  same gigantic span of the algebra world. I regard these books less as pedagogical tools than, like Bour-ba-ki group, to prove something is doable --- to make the human achievement of doing X---for posterity and for the mathematical forward guard, not for learners.

&dagger; For beginners I recommend the much shorter math.miami.edu/~ec/book .

&doubledagger; I preferred skimming across several _Algebra_ books, looking for differences in esthetic, rather than trying to learn one man's All Of Everything viewpoint.



I prefer books with a more specific scope --- eg Reid UAG, Harris CAwavtAG,
