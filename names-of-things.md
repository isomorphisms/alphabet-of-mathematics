## programmers and mathematicians


Mathematicians should use the long name for things when it doesn't take up  too much space. For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture

> where the quantities on the right hand side are invariants of the curve, studied by Cassels, Tate, Shafarevich and others: these include the order of the torsion group, the order of the Tateâ€“Shafarevich group, and the canonical heights of a basis of rational points (Wiles 2006).


the  first presentation to an outsider should just read:

```
The number of rational points R on an elliptic curve E with one hole (E's genus=1)                 Number of ___ &times; Number of ____ &times; Number of ____
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------        =         --------------
R!    (to adjust for ___)                                
```


rather than asking the reader to fill in a bunch of weird Greek letters with what they are defined as elsewhere.











## Namespaces

Mathematicians have used words taht other people use, to mean specialised things. Sometimes a mathematical expositor will feel the need to clarify that

- category
- ideal
- group


does not refer to the specialised mathematical meaning of that word. That is bad.
